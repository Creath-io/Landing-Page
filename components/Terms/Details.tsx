        “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or similar digital item

        uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain

        Creath is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial
        institution, money services business, or creditor. Creath provides a
        peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users discover and directly
        interact with each other on NFTs, products and services available on
        public block chains. We do not have custody or control over the NFTs or
        block chains you are interacting with and we do not execute or
        effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of such NFTs, products or
        services. To use our Services, you must use a third-party wallet which
        allows you to engage in transactions on block chains.

        Creath is not party to any agreement between any users. You bear full

        of NFTs, or products/services that you purchase from third-party sellers
        using the Service and we make no claims about the identity, legitimacy,
        functionality, or authenticity of users or NFTs (and any content

      <p className="text-secondary text-[17px] md:text-xl leading-10">
        Because we have a growing number of products/services, we sometimes need
        to provide additional terms for specific products or services (and such
        products/services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall
        also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions,
        which are available with the relevant service, then become part of your
        agreement with us if you use those products or services. In the event of
        a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we
        may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall

      <p className="text-secondary text-[17px] md:text-xl leading-10">
        Like much of web3, your block chain addresses functions as your identity
        on Creath. Accordingly, you will need a block chain address and a
        third-party wallet to access the Service. Your account on the service
        (“Account”) will be associated with your block chain address; however,
        if you want to add some flair to your Creath persona, you can add
        additional information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.{" "}

      <p className="text-secondary text-[17px] md:text-xl leading-10">
        Your Account on Creath will be associated with your linked block chain
        address and display the NFTs for that block chain address (and, if
        applicable, any content associated with such NFTs). By using your wallet
        in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet
        under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet.
        Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Creath,
        and Creath does not have custody or control over the contents of your
        wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Creath
        accepts no responsibility for or liability to you, in connection with
        your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties
        regarding how the Service will operate with any specific wallet. You are
        solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should never
        share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you
        discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet
        provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any
        associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you
        in connection with your Account or as a result of your Account or wallet
        being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or
        otherwise suspect any security issues related to the product, service or

        foregoing, by using this Service, you represent and warrant that: (a)
        you are not located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized under the
        laws of any jurisdiction that is subject to a comprehensive Government
        embargo ("Embargoed Jurisdiction"); (b) you are not subject to any

        Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement in
        this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to
        arbitrate disputes with Creath and limits the manner in which you can
        seek relief from us. This section does not govern disputes between users
        or between users and third parties. Creath does not provide dispute
        resolution services for such disagreements and the parties must resolve
        those disputes directly.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="text-secondary text-[17px] md:text-xl leading-10">
        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute,
        controversy, or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the
        Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, or to
        any aspect of your relationship with Creath, will be resolved by binding
        arbitration, rather than in court, including threshold questions of the
        arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or claim except that (1) you
        or Creath may assert claims in small claims court, but only if the
        claims qualify, the claims remain only in such court, and the claims
        remain on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis; and
        (2) you or Creath may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of
        proper jurisdiction if the claim relates to intellectual property
        infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="text-secondary text-[17px] md:text-xl leading-10">
        Dispute resolution process. You and Creath both agree to engage in
        good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to either party initiating
        arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for
        intellectual property infringement. You must initiate this dispute
        resolution process by sending a letter describing the nature of your
        claim and desired resolution to: Creath Innovations Ltd, Attn: Legal
        Department, 40A, Oyibo Adjarho Street, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos State,
        Nigeria. Both parties agree to meet and confer personally, by telephone,
        or by video conference (hereinafter “Conference”) to discuss the dispute
        and attempt in good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that
        avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If
        you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the
        Conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the
        Conference. Likewise, if Creath is represented by counsel, its counsel
        may participate in the Conference as well, but Creath agrees to have a
        company representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute
        of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the
        parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process and Conference
        required by this paragraph. If the parties do not reach agreement to
        resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after initiation of this
        dispute resolution process, either party may commence arbitration, file
        an action in small claims court, or file a claim for injunctive or
        equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction for matters relating
        to intellectual property infringement, if the claims qualify.{" "}

        Arbitration Rules. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act CAP 18, LFN 2004
        is the legislation for the enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To
        begin an arbitration proceeding after participating in the dispute
        resolution process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and
        describing your claim to our registered agent at Creath Innovations Ltd,
        Attn: Legal Department,40A, Oyibo Adjarho Street, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos
        State, Nigeria. The arbitration will be conducted in English. You are
        still responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the
        arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert
        witnesses. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone
        or video conference, based on written submissions, in person in Lagos
        State area (if you live in Nigeria). Any judgment on the award rendered
        by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.{" "}

      <p className="text-secondary text-[17px] md:text-xl leading-10">
        Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority
        to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
        Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
        applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration
        Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part
        of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will
        decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Creath. The
        arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters
        or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the
        authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
        arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to
        grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
        applicable law, rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a
        written award and statement of decision describing the essential
        findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
        calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
        authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court
        of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
        you and us.{" "}

        Waiver of Court proceedings. YOU AND CREATH HEREBY WAIVE ANY
        CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
        JURISDICTION AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE. You and Creath are
        instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
        arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified above
        (“Applicability of Arbitration Agreement”). An arbitrator can award on
        an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must
        follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge in
        arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very
        limited review.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="text-secondary text-[17px] md:text-xl leading-10">
        Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
        WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS
        AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE
        ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR
        ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this
        section, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one
        party’s claims to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the
        generality of the foregoing, you and Creath agree that no dispute shall
        proceed by way of class arbitration. If a decision is issued stating
        that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this
        subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim
        must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the courts located
        in Lagos State, Nigeria. All other claims shall be arbitrated.{" "}

        effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration
